/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/

1. Starting with reading the handouts very carefully because lots of useful information is contained in it. 
In addition, you should clearly remember the class members in search.py and sokoban.py and they can help with
both coding and debugging.

2. Alternate heuristic is a difficult function and you should consider lots of cases. But it could be divided
into two parts and I call them: infinite distance part and distance penalty part.

3. The inifinite distance part will include state when there is never a solution. In this case, you should 
return the infinit distance to kind of terminate this successor. Distance penalty means that when there is another 
box or walls on the way to the destination. The distance should be a little larger than the original 
manhanttan distance.
